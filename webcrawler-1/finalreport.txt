FINAL REPORT
======================================
GOAL was to crawl beatprot tracks database and find the same tracks on spotify to display found common tracks on both platforms.

Crawled the Beatprot tracks and saved the cached downloaded HTML to folder on File System. Upto ?pages=(1|n=>infinity)

Crawled spotify to get artist, artist albums, and album tracks to get same track on both platforms using exact Match of Track Name and Artist Name.

Displayed the results in pure HTML table.

=====================================================
POINTS OF FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------------
Exact Match can be replaced by Fuzzy join, or in-case sensitive search to get more same tracks but this could introduce some tracks which are not exactly same.

Matching like - remix, -original, - old etc could be added.

Caching of pages and spotify data is good, but needs to add a mechanism to clear cached data after (XX number of hours).
